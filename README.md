# studyBuddy
Java application to assist in my study. It is intended to be used with a learning 
resource such as a book that has end of section/chapter problems for the learner 
to practice. 

If your chapter has 20 problems available, you input 20 and the program outputs 
four numbers between 1 and 20 inclusive.

Potential upgrades:
    Add a GUI. 
    Add pomodoro timer. 
    Add database support to keep track of which problems from which chapters the user has already solved. If the user 
    revisits a previous chapter, the application should not suggest problems that have already been solved. Could 
    potentially provide a check box for the user to decide if previously solved problems should be included.

Version 0.1
    Console application that takes the number of problems available as input and randomly chooses 4 numbers for the user 
    to study.
